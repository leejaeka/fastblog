<blockquote>
  <p>Black Saber has been a grouping company in the past 7 years. From the data in the past 7 years we want to determine whether or not the promotion, salary, and hiring processes are fair. That is, if these processes are only related to talent and performance and not other factors. The three research question are: * Fairness of promotion process: is the promotion process only related to talent and performance but not other factors? * Fairness of salary process: is the salary process only related to talent and performance but not other factors? * Fairness of hiring process: is the hiring process only related to qualifications and talentbut not other factors?</p>

  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The company has been steadily grouping since 2013.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Roughly 10% of employees receives a promotion every quarter, which comes with a salary increase. This means the promotion and salary processes are not independent of each other and occurs simultaneously.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A point to note is that employees with higher seniority, they not only have a higher base salary, they also have higher salary increase. This means the gap between the different seniority will increase even more.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The promotion process is slightly unfair: Women and gender group of “prefer not to say” have had a lower promotion chance than men in Black Saber, while productivity or leadership (which is related to talent and performance) had no major impact on an employee’s chance on getting promoted.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Salary process is slightly unfair: for the same reason as the promotion process.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>the hiring process is fair: it only relates to qualifications and talents, and is not gender biased or influenced by other factors</p>

<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>

  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For the promotion and salary sections: the first few quarters have very few employees. The smaller sample size lead to more variance and potential inaccuracy in the analysis</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For the hiring section: some of the important variables found during the initial analysis were not explained well enough in the generalized linear mixed-effects model analysis. For instance, we found that having a cover letter is crucial to an applicant for them to pass the first phase, but the model results show that having a cover letter is not relevant or significant.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For the hiring section: The number of observations are too small for the data used and collected in the last two phases of the hiring process, this could potentially cause fluctuations</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The aim of this report is to check if the company’s promotion, salary, and hiring processes are fair, in the sense that it is only based on talent and performance and not other factors. Thus, there are three separate but related research questions about these three processes. In each research question, an initial exploratory analysis was performed to explore the data. Next, multiple models are made and compared with each other for model selection. Finally, the selected model is used to explain the results obtains about the fairness of each of the research questions. In particular, the models used include logistic and other GLMMs (general linear mixed models).</p>

<h2 id="fairness-of-the-promotion-process">Fairness of the promotion process</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this section, we want to use appropriate statistical tools to determine whether or not the promotion process is fair. That is, the promotion process only depends on talent or performance and there are little or no bias towards gender or other non-performance-related variables.</p>

  <p><strong>Data description, wrangling, and exploratory analysis</strong> The data we focus on this section is current employee data, where the variable description is included in appendix 1.1. The two main variable of interest are the seniority levels (role_seniornty) and financial quarters (financial_q). In particular, a change in an employee’s seniority level between two financial quarters represents a promotion received by that employee between the two financial quarters. In the wrangling of the data, several new variables of were created:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among these variables, diff_role and total_prom are of significant interest while the other three are only to help with easier data manipulations or simplifications.</p>

  <p>Next, we conduct some exploratory analysis to look at the distribution of employees in Black Saber through the following plots: 1.1: Distribution seniority roles over employee quarters; 1.2: Distribution of leadership level over employee quarters; 1.3: Distribution of Team over employee quarters; 1.4: Histogram of numbers of employees and numbers of quarters served; 1.5: Number of employees over time. Note that employee quarters are represented by the numbers of quarters multiply the numbers of employee.</p>

  <p>Number of Quarters Served Time Steps (Quarterly)</p>

  <p>From figure 1.1, we see that the distribution of seniority ranks resembles a left skewed normal distribution, and that the vast majority of employees range from entry level to senior III over the employee quarters. Figure 1.2 shows that most employees have appropriate leadership for their levels across the financial quarters with slightly more employee quarters exceeding expectations than needing improvements. Figure 1.3 shows the total number of employee quarters worked by employees of different teams. From these three plots, we are intended to say that the majority of employees may also range from entry level to senior III; most employees have appropriate leadership for their levels; and less amount of employee quarters worked by a team may suggests that fewer employees are from that team. However, this may not be true since this assumes that the composition of seniority, leadership, and teams are similar in proportions through the financial quarters. Figure 1.5 shows that the number of employees has been growing steadily since the company was founded in 2013 Q2 (1st time step). Figure 1.4 suggest that there are more employees who worked fewer quarters than those who worked more quarters. This tells us that there are more newer employees than older ones which is in agreement with figure 1.5.</p>

  <p>Next, we look at four more plots about promotions: 1.6: Histogram of number of promotions; 1.7: Distribution of promotion rate across quarter ranks (quarter_rank); 1.8: Promotion rate across teams; 1.9: Promotion rate across productivity groups (prod_group).</p>

  <p>Figure 1.6 suggests that there are fewer employees who got more promotions and more employees with little or no promotions. Knowing that most employees are newer employees and that Black Saber has hired more employee over time, this is expected. Figure 1.7 suggest that promotion rate is roughly the same for each quarter averaging around 0.1 (this means on average 10% of the employees will get a promotion every quarter). In 7th quarter (2014 Q4) where the promotion rate is exceptionally high at around 0.35, but this is likely an outlier due to fewer employees at the time. From figure 1.8, we see that design, people and talent, and software teams tend to have higher promotion rate than the other teams. The red dotted line (for plots H and I) marks the median promotion rate quarterly, where the median was chosen instead of the means because the outlier promotion rate in the 7th quarter is acknowledged. Plot H may suggest slight unfairness in the promotion processes, but the difference between the team with the lowest promotion rate and the team with the highest promotion rate is very small (&gt;3%). Lastly, figure 1.9 may appear to suggest that the highest promotion rate occurs at around prod_group = 3, while increasing productivity after that may result in decrease promotion rate. This may suggest unfairness in the promotion processes; however, we cannot say this certain because this plot does not take into account many other factors such as current position of the employee. For instance, if an employee with high productivity is already a director than it is more unlikely for that employee to get a promotion, especially when the company already have a Vice president and isn’t in need of another one.</p>

  <p><strong>Modeling section</strong> Since promotion has a binary outcome, logistic models are the most appropriate. Before fitting the model, we briefly examine the log odds and see if they have strong correlation with any of the variables. Among the variables, three of them stood out to appear to have strong pattern associated with the log odds, these are gender, productivity rank, and salary group (see appendix 1.2). This suggests that there might be significant relationship between these variables and promotion.</p>

  <p>The next step is to find a good model for promotion. In brief, a total of four GLMM (general linear mixed models) were fitted and compared through ANOVA for model selection (see appendix 1.3). Using this method, we determined that a model named mod2 is the best model. This model has the least numbers of parameters and is considered a simpler model. The reasons for this is that mod2 has the smallest AIC and BIC. Moreover, when we conduct ANOVA on mod2 with the other three models we do not see a significant p-value less than 0.05. This suggest that the other three models which is nested and has additional parameters is not significantly differently from mod2.</p>

  <p>In the final model, the response variable is an indicator variable of an individual getting a promo- tion (diff_role); the fixed effects prod_group, salary_group, gender, leadership_rank, and seniority_rank; the random effects are employee_id and quarter_rank. This model assumes that promotion should be unrelated to quarter, and we have checked our assumption earlier in plot G</p>

  <p>which shows that promotion rate is roughly the same every quarter. Let 𝑌𝑖,𝑗 be an indicator variable recording if the 𝑗𝑡ℎ promotion from Quarter 𝑖 was given to employee 𝑘. Let $ p_{i[k]j}$ be the true probability that the 𝑗𝑡ℎ promotion from the 𝑖𝑡ℎ financial quarter is given to an employee rather than some one else. We can interpret the final model using a two-level approach:</p>

  <p>Level 1:</p>

  <p>𝑝𝑖[𝑘]𝑗</p>

  <p>𝑙𝑜𝑔(</p>

  <p>1 − 𝑝</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this section, we want to use appropriate statistical tools to determine whether or not the salary process is fair. That is, the salary process only depends on talent or performance and there are little or no bias towards gender or other non-performance-related variables.</p>

  <p><strong>Data wrangling and exploratory analysis</strong> In the salary section, we use the same data set from the promotion section above. For the data wrangling, only one new variable was added to the data set: pay_up, which is an indicator variable that indicates whether or not an employee has received an increase in salary between two quarters, where 0 indicates no increase, while 1 indicates increase. We found that pay_up takes on the exact same value as diff_role from the promotion section, which means that an increase in salary occurs when and only when an employee also receives a promotion.</p>

  <p>Next, some exploratory analyses are performed.</p>

Figure 2.2 shows the weighted pay increase as a percent over time.

  <p>Figures 2.6 shows quarterly average salary for different seniority, where we also see that the average salary increase with seniority rank. We also notice that these averages are roughly the same across quarters. Figure 2.7 shows average pay increase rate in percentage of salary over quarters. We wee all teams roughly averages at the same rate with few outlying exceptions across the quarters. Lasty, figure 2.8 depicts the average salary increase rate over time, which is similar to the promotion rate over time from the previous section, this is excepted as salary increases and promotions happens together. Again, we see the increase rate does not change much throughout the quarters except for the one of the earlier quarters.</p>

  <p><strong>Modeling section</strong> There was total 569 pay increases over 30 quarters. 277 not pay increase, 155 got once, 84 got twice, 53 got 3, 15 got 4 times, 1 person got 7 pay increases. We can see over 50% pay increases happened to the employees who got twice or more than two pay increases. It is not likely the pay increase behavior from these employees is independent. Hence multiple linear least squares regression using all 569 pay increase observations is advisable for this study.</p>

  <p>First step to modeling is checking model assumptions. Since we know that there are employees who have had multiple promotions and salary raise before, we know the independence assumption is not met. Specifically, each observed salary raise is not completely independent from the rest since every</p>

  <p>employee can get more than one promotion and salary raise. To check if we may still use GLMMs, we must look at the distribution of average salary change rate shown in figure 2.9 and 2.10. Figure</p>

  <p>2.9 includes all the observations of salary increases, meaning that the same employee who got more than one salary increase is counted multiple times. On the other hand, Figure 2.10 shows only unique employees who got salary increases. We see that the two distributions are not vastly different which means our assumptions are met and we may proceed with GLMMs.</p>

  <p>Next, we used the same method of comparing ANOVA tables in the promotion section for model selection (see appendix 2.1). Using this method, we determined that a model named model3 is the best model. This time, however, all 4 models that were compared were very similar. model3 was chosen simply because the variables included are the most meaningful, and that it had a slightly smaller AIC and BIC.</p>

  <p>In the final model, the response variable is salary_num which is the same as salary but numeric instead of a string; the fixed effects prod_group, diff_role, gender, leadership_rank, and seniority_rank; the random effects ia employee_id.

<h2 id="fairness-of-the-hiring-process">Fairness of the hiring process</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Relationship between the fairness of the hiring process and applicant’s talent level and gender</strong> Our second question aims to uncover if the hiring process is fair based on applicants’ talent, which is investigating if the applicants’ level of competence and achievement in GPA, extracurricular experiences, work experiences, technical skills, writing skills, leadership skills, and speaking skills can directly positively affect the result of their application. We are also interested in finding if the results are biased based on gender specifically. This question is important to be discussed and addressed as diversity in the work environment is desired, we also want to ensure that all employed applicants are competent to present a high level of performance for increase and ensure maximized productivity and eﬀiciency are achieved.</p>

  <p><strong>Data wrangling, data description and initial findings</strong> The data sets used in this question in- cluding current employee data, data on newly-graduated applicants who qualified for phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, and data on newly-graduated applicants who were eventually hired. In the first phase of the hiring pipeline applicants complete a form and are asked to submit a CV and cover letter. Extracurriculars and internship experience are autorated based on the descriptions applicants provide in the application form. In the second phase, the applicants are asked to complete one technical task, one writing task, and submit a pre-recorded video. The specific scores achieved by each applicant is AI-autograded. In the third phase of the, the applicants are interviewed and graded by two separate interviewers. We also conducted some initial analysis to investigate the relationships and correlations between variables prior to the statistics model construction and fitting process to figure out what variables are of interest in the analysis.</p>

  <p>The data is collected and provided by the employer/client in this situation.</p>

  <p>The next procedure done is to combine all data sets including data on newly-graduated applicants who qualified for phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, and data on newly-graduated applicants who were eventually hired to create a new data frame that contains 17 variables in total. The detailed description of variables in the new data set can be found in appendix 3.0. This procedure is important as we are interested in examining all aspects and level of competence of all applicants. We then coerced all arguments to either factor or numeric values in order to generate graphs illustrating various relationships and correlations for the initial analysis.</p>

  <p>It is interested to find out the correlation between interview ratings and whether or not the applicants got hired(making it past phase 4). We combined the ratings that each applicant received in the first interview and second interview, and divided the ratings by 2 to obtain an average interview rating. A box plot labelled as figure 3.1 is created down below to illustrate the relationship, where the category 0 on the x-axis means that the applicant did not get hired, and the category 1 means that the applicant received a job offer. From the diagram, it is clearly evident that the applicants who are eventually hired have a much higher interquartile range and median values for interview ratings than those who did not get hired, suggesting a direct and strong indication that higher interview ratings definitely contributes to getting hired.</p>

From the diagram, it is clearly evident that the applicants who are eventually hired have a much higher GPA scores than those who did not get hired, suggesting a direct and strong indication that higher GPA scores definitely contributes to getting hired.</p>

  <p>We also analyzed the relationship between gender and interview score to see if there is any bias towards giving higher interview scores to a specific gender. We constructed a box plot which categorized the data into teams which are data and software. Figure 3.3 is shown below, and it is evident that men generally are given a higher interview score than women regardless of their talent. We can see that for both teams, men tend to have higher interquartile range and median values for the interview scores, which could suggest that there is bias that interviewers are more lenient towards giving male applicants higher interview scores than female applicants. This is further analyzed and discussed in the model fitting part after.</p>

  <p>Since work experience often plays a crucial role in the hiring process, we wanted to see if work experience also affects the interview score. A box plot is constructed below with categorization based on the different team that each applicant applied for. Evidently shown in figure 3.4, for the data team, the applicants with mediocre work experience(category 1 on the x-axis) has the highest median value for interview scores, it also has the largest interquartile range. For the software team however, applicants with the most experience tend to score higher in interviews, with smaller interquartile range and highest median values. In general, it is unclear as to how work experience affects the interview score, and this should be further analyzed after fitting linear models to the data.</p>

  <p>Other than interview ratings and GPA scores, we are also curious to find out the correlation between other variables that measure each applicant’s talent and whether or not they are hired. To achieve that, a new variable called talent_score is created. This new measurement is calculated by adding together each applicant’s technical skills, writing skills, leadership presence and speaking skills, and then divided by four to obtain an average. One thing to be noticed is that because leadership presence and speaking skills are graded on a scale of ten, for the purpose of unity, we multiplied those scores by 10 for the calculation of talent scores. The new data set created is named “all_applicants_data” with 613 observations and 18 variables. The new variable “talent_score” is describe below.</p>

  <p>Variable name Type Description</p>

  <p>talent_score str Score of each applicant’s talent, on a scale of 100</p>

  <p>We then investigated the relationship between talent scores and the results of whether the applicant is hired based on genders, and constructed a box plot down below. Evidently shown below in figure 3.6, for those who are not hired(category “0” on the x-axis), the talent score is generally lower regardless of gender, but it is also noted that male applicants have an averagely higher talent scores</p>

  <p>than female applicants, reflective in both higher interquartile range and median value. It is also noted that the hired applicants(category “1” on the x-axis) have a much higher talent score overall in both genders, but male applicants still have higher scores than female applicants. This could reflect a phenomenon that male applicants tend to receive higher talent scores than female applicants, but it is unclear as to whether this resulted from actual differences in skill levels, or there is a bias lenient towards grading male applicants with higher scores.</p>

  <p><strong>Data Exploration for phase 1 and 2</strong> For the model selection and fitting portion, we decided to construct models based on different phases of the interview process to clearly distinguish the most impactful component that affects whether or not the applicant passed the first phase, received an interview and got hired eventually, and to see if there is a gender gap during the process. We also conducted some data exploration prior to the model construction and fitting process for better understanding of the statistics and importance of each variable</p>

  <p>## [1] “33.333333 percent of applicants made it to phase 2”</p>

  <p>Firstly we looked at the data of the applicants who successfully passed phase 1 of the interview process. The data set used in this section and the section below is “all_applicants_data” with 613 observations and 18 different variables. We added a “phase 2” column to the data frame recording the applicants who passed phase 1 and divided the data frame based on different teams each applicant applied for, and constructed a table above that summarizes the number of applicants who passed phase 1 by gender. Evidently shown in table 3.1, the statistics suggest that approximately 33.33% of the applicants passed phase 1, with no clear distinction in passing rate between different genders, the odds of a male applicant passing phase 1 is almost identical with the odds of a female applicant passing phase 1 for both the data team and the software team.</p>

  <p>We also calculated and obtain some mutual information to see what variables can best explain our response variable “phase2”, which is whether or not an applicant passed the first phase of the hiring</p>

  <p>process,the best. The specific variables used are the team that each applicant applied for, whether or not the applicant submitted a cover letter and a resume, the gender of the applicant, the level of extracurricular involvement, work experience, and GPA of each applicant. The intuition is that, higher the score, the better. The specific values are calculated above in table 3.2. It is evident to point out that the most dominant variable that affects our response variable is whether or not the applicant submitted a cover letter.</p>

  <p>Further analysis proves that having a cover letter is the most impactful variable that makes an applicant pass phase 1 and 2 of the hiring process. Table 3.3 presented above shows that those applicants with no cover letter are all rejected in the first two phases of the hiring process.</p>

  <p><strong>Model Fitting for phase 1</strong> After performing some exploratory analysis, we moved on to construct- ing and analyzing the models. Since the first phase of the hiring process has a binary outcome(passed or rejected), therefore we constructed models with binary response variable. t is also unlikely that each explanatory variable is independent of each other. The response variable interested is whether or not an applicant passed the first phase of the hiring process, with a random effect of applicant ids, while the other potential explanatory variables include the team that each applicant applied for, whether or not the applicant submitted a cover letter and a resume, the gender of the applicant, the level of extracurricular involvement, work experience, and GPA of each applicant.</p>

  <p>In brief, two generalized linear mixed-effects model were fitted and compared through ANOVA for model selection (see appendix 3.1). Using this method, we determined that a model named model_1b is the best model. This model has the least numbers of parameters and is considered a simpler model. In addition, the selected has a lower value in both the AIC and BIC values, suggesting that the likelihood that this model better predicts or estimates the future values for this data set.</p>

  <p>The chosen model includes 6 explanatory variables including the team that each applicant applied for, whether or not the applicant submitted a cover letter and a resume, the level of extracurricular involvement, work experience, and GPA of each applicant. The null hypothesis is that the correlation between the previously mentioned explanatory variables and the response variable is not 0. It is interesting to notice that the model which does not consider gender as an explanatory variable better</p>

  <p>fits the data set, suggesting that gender is most definitely not a determining factor that affects whether or not an applicant passes the first phase of the hiring process.</p>

  <p>The results of the model can be recorded as an equation down below, where xt records the theorized result of whether or not the applicant passes phase 1</p>

  <p>The summary of the selected model can also be found in appendix 3.1. Notice that most of the p-values for the explanatory variables are above the threshold of 0.05 except for GPA. The p-value for the GPA value is calculated to be about 0.000117, which means that there is incentive not to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that this variable is significant. We can also see that the estimated value for the GPA variable is positive, suggesting that it can be concluded that having a higher GPA has positive influence on whether or not an applicant passes the first two phases of the interview process. There is indication that the other 5 explanatory variables have profound impact or significance in this model. The results also suggest that an applicant with a higher GPA is 11.9646 times more likely to pass the first phase</p>

  <p><strong>Data Exploration for phase 2</strong> Next we focused on the data on the applicants that passed through phase 2 of the interview process. Phase 2 of the interview process focuses on evaluating each applicant’s technical skills, writing skills, speaking skills and competence in leadership presence. We removed columns that include results in phase 1 and phase 3 of the data set, as well as each applicant’s ratings in the two separate interviews.</p>

  <p>## [1] “7.333333 percent of applicants made it to phase 3”</p>

  <p>We also constructed a table above that summarizes the number of applicants who passed phase 2 by gender. Evidently shown in table 3.4, the statistics suggest that approximately 7.33% of the applicants who passed phase 1 also passed phase 2. It can also be noted that the number of female applicants who passed phase 2 of the interview process is less than half of the number of male applicants that passed phase 2, despite the fact that more women passed the first and the second phases of the hiring process. There is incentive for us to believe that there is some level of gender gap in the hiring process, and this should be specifically studied in the model analysis to see if there is significant correlation between gender and whether the applicant passes the third phase of the hiring process.</p>

  <p><strong>Model Fitting for phase 2</strong> After performing some exploratory analysis, we moved on to con- structing and analyzing the models. Since the second phase of the hiring process have a binary outcome(passed or rejected), therefore we constructed models with binary response variable. It is also unlikely that each explanatory variable is independent of each other. Six generalized linear mixed- effects model were fitted and compared through ANOVA for model selection (see appendix 3.2). In the models, the response variable interested is whether or not the applicant passed phase 2, with a random effect of applicant ids, while the other potential explanatory variables include the gender of each applicant, each applicant’s technical skills, writing skills, speaking skills and competence in leadership presence. As previously mentioned, we consider the four skills as parts of the applicant’s talent.</p>

  <p>By comparing the AIC values provided by the ANOVA table, it is conclusive that the model that fits the data set better is the last model. However, based on the BIC values, “model_2d” has the lowest value, but this model only contains one explanatory variable, meaning that this model could potentially not give us a thorough analysis of the correlation between different variables. Therefore, we choose to analyze the last model, “model_2f” for analysis.</p>

  <p>The selected model has a null hypothesis that the correlation between the explanatory variables and the response variable is not 0.</p>

  <p>The results of the model can be recorded as an equation down below, where xt records the theorized result of whether or not the applicant passes phase 2</p>

  <p>The summary of the selected model can also be found in appendix 3.2. Notice that most of the p-values for the explanatory variables are all below the threshold of 0.05, meaning that there is incentive not to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that all explanatory variables are significant</p>

  <p>and there is a positive correlation between having higher talent scores and passing phase 2. We can also see that the estimated values for all explanatory variables are positive, suggesting that it can be concluded that having a higher talent score has positive influence on whether or not an applicant passes the first two phases of the interview process. There is indication that all explanatory variables have profound impact or significance in this model. The results also suggest that an applicant with a higher speaking skills is 5.8 times more likely to pass the second phase, 7.916 times more likely for higher leadership presence, 0.6565 times more likely with higher technical skills, and 0.8987 times more likely with higher writing skills. It is also noted that gender is not considered in this model, meaning that there is no indication that a bias exists towards favoring any single gender when grading each applicant in terms of skills.</p>

  <p>We also constructed a table above that summarizes the number of applicants who passed phase 3 by gender. Evidently shown in table 3.4, the statistics suggest that approximately 45.45% of the applicants who passed phase 2 also passed phase 3. It is noted that if an applicant passed phase 3, that applicant is hired and is sent an offer. It can also be noted that the number of female applicants who passed phase 3 of the interview process is only 25% of the number of male applicants that passed phase 3, and male applicants had a higher acceptance rate than female applicants. There is incentive for us to believe that there could be some level of gender gap in the hiring process, however, because of the small number of observations in the final number of applicants who are hired, it would be impossible to include gender as an explanatory variable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In brief, the analyses on promotion and salary processes suggest that these processes are unfair. The high similarity between promotion and salary relation are resulted by the fact that promotions and salary changes happen simultaneously and thus not independent of each other. We found that these processes are not only gender bias, they also does not reflect on employees’ leadership or productivity, which are related to talent or performance.</p>

  <p>For the Hiring process, after performing data exploration and model fitting to the data recorded in all phases, there are several crucial findings to be noted. Based on the regression model analysis, for an</p>

  <p>applicant to pass phase 1, the most important aspect is to have a high GPA. For an applicant to pass phase 2, they need to score high on writing skills, speaking skills, technical skills, and demonstrate competence in showing leader presence. For an applicant to pass phase 3 and finally get hired, they need to perform exceptionally well on the two interviews. Regardless of what phase the applicant is in, gender does not seem to have any significant impact as to whether the applicant passes the phase or not. With that being said, it seems that the hiring process is fair.</p>

<h4 id="strengths-and-limitations">Strengths and limitations</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A strength in the promotion and salary section is that model assumption were checked and appropriate models were used for the corresponding situations. Moreover, much exploratory analysis has been conducted to understand the data.</p>

  <p>One of the limitations for the promotion and salary sections is a limited amount of info about the structure or company policies, and knowing certain polices may help understanding the context of a statistic better. For instance, we were able to figure that salary changes when and only when promotion is given. This was crucial for our understanding of the data. However, other information might be hidden about why, for instance, promotion and salary is not related to productivity or leadership – even though we would think that they should correlate.</p>

  <p>Another limitation for the models in the promotion and salary sections is the large variances from the first few quarters. As the first few quarter black saber had no more than 20 employees, the ratios of promotion rates and salary change may be more volatile and result in lager variances in our model and possibly influence the calculations of the regression coeﬀicients.</p>

  <p>A strength for the hiring section is that the detailed analysis of correlation between various variables that gives deep insight as to whether or not the hiring process is fair based on each applicant’s talent and gender. Moreover, multiple generalized linear mixed-effects model analyses are performed for data on each phase of the hiring process, giving us more reliability and accuracy on the results</p>

  <p>For the hiring section, one limitation to be noted is that during the initial data exploration of phase 1, we noticed that applicants who did not submit a cover letter were all rejected. However, when we constructed and fitted a regression model analysis, it is found that having a cover letter is not a significant explanatory variable, which is quite contradictory and hard to be explained. There might be some underlying assumptions that were violated when constructing the models.</p>

  <p>In addition, for the third and last phases of the hiring process, the number of observations that were available for use is quite low, and there were not too many variables to be analyzed. Even though we have still constructed and fitted a regression model and generated analysis, it is feared that this procedure is quite redundant, as the results obtained are rather intuitive and self-explanatory.</p>
